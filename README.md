# APISamples
Snippets/Code samples using the JobTracker API (which also works with Systemize). For more information, visit the [JTAPI Developer Site](https://developer.moraware.com/)

## V4 vs V5
All of the samples in V4Samples work with V5 as well. All of the samples in V5Samples require version 5 or above of the JobTracker API.

## Usage
To try out these snippets, it's helpful to use a simple console app, like the [JTSample](https://github.com/Moraware/JTSample) project. Simply copy-and-paste the appropriate snippet into that console app to see what it can do.
